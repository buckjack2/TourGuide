# TourGuide

What will I learn?

This project is about combining various ideas and skills.
They include:

    Planning your app design and navigation before coding.
    Selecting proper data structures to store lists of information.
    Building layouts to display those lists of data.
    Navigating between those lists using intents and multiple Activities or a ViewPager.
    Creating your own custom classes.
    Properly handling images or audio (if applicable).
